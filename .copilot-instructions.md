# ai-governor – Copilot Instructions

You are assisting development of ai-governor, a model-level governance runtime.

STRICT RULES:
- Do NOT introduce new governance concepts in v0.3.x
- Do NOT modify policy schema v0.1 semantics
- Do NOT add provider-specific logic
- Do NOT add compliance or legal claims
- Do NOT change enforcement order
- Do NOT add new CLI flags without discussion

ALLOWED:
- Bug fixes
- Internal refactoring without behavior change
- Tests
- Documentation improvements
- Performance optimizations

ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES:
- Enforcement must be deterministic
- Audit failures must be fail-fast
- All decisions must be auditable
- Policy validation happens before enforcement
- Examples live under /examples only

If a suggestion violates these rules, explain why instead of implementing it.
